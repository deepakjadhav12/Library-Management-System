# Library-Management-System
This project involves building a simple library management system in C++. This system would allow the librarian to manage books and keep track of issued books. The librarian should be able to add new books, search for books, issue a book, and return a book.
The project will provide students an opportunity to apply knowledge of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and more in a practical scenario. It will also involve implementing essential algorithms for searching and sorting.
